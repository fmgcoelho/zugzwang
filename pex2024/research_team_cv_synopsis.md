# Research team CV synopsis

- Francisco Coelho completed his PhD in Informatics in 2006 at Universidade de Lisboa under the supervision of Helder Coelho on Artificial Intelligence. Is previous formation is on Mathematics, where he has a Master degree in Mathematics, specialty Algebra, with a dissertation about Hilbert's tenth problem and about geometric computation, advised by Prof. Augusto Franco de Oliveira and Prof. José Félix Costa.

Currently he is Assistant Professor at the Computer Science department of Universidade de Évora, where he has coordinated more than twenty courses and restructured or proposed other six, to the graduation and master degrees. He is supervising three PhD thesis and two MSc dissertations and has supervised other six completed MSc dissertations.

He contributed with software and writing to papers covering a wide range of subjects but mostly about logic and statistical AI. He is integrated member of the Intelligent Systems of the research unit NOVALINCS and member of the scientific team of the High Performance Computing Chair.

- Bruno Dinis completed his PhD in Maths in 2013 at the University of Évora under the supervision of Imme van den Berg on Nonstandard Analysis.

After his doctoral studies, he was a postdoc at the Faculdade de Ciências under the supervision of Fernando Ferreira, working on Proof Theory.

Bruno Dinis is currently an Assistant Professor at the Universidade de Évora. Co-supervised 1 master's dissertation.

He has written over 20 papers on several aspects of logic, for the most part in proof interpretations and its applications (proof mining).

- Salvador Abreu is Full Professor at the University of Évora (UE) School of Science and Technology since 2013, Senior Researcher at NOVA LINCS and President of the Scientific Council at the UE Institute for Research and Advanced Training (IIFA). He currently directs the PhD Program in Informatics at UE.

He holds a Habilitation in Informatics from the University of Évora (2009), a PhD in Informatics from Universidade NOVA de Lisboa (1994), and a BSc in Informatics Engineering from Universidade Nova de Lisboa (1987).

Salvador successfully supervised 9 doctoral theses and is currently directing 3. He was granted an IBM SUR award in 2013 and a JSPS Invitation Fellowship in 2015. He participates or participated as a project member or Principal Investigator in nationally and European funded projects, including OAR, AJACS, STAMPA, JEDI, HORUS, VAPS, BIOECOSYS, AI4EU, EUGREEN and PaCoMoCo.

- Miguel Avillez (PhD in Astrophysics) is a tenured research full professor in Astrophysics at the Institute for Research and Advanced Training, University of Évora, being the Chair-holder of the High Performance Computing Chair. He is a guest professor at the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics of the Technical University Berlin, Germany. He is the director of the High Performance Computing Centre of the University of Évora that houses the the OBLIVION Supercomputer. His research focuses on theoretical and computational astrophysics, computational atomic physics, and numerical analysis, studying the evolution of the interstellar medium in galaxies, the stars life cycle, the circulation of matter between the disks and galactic halos, and, more recently, the distribution of elements in the first galaxies formed after the Big Bang. In addition he is deeply involved in software development, refactoring and acceleration to take advantage of supercomputing facilities and exascale computing. 

His research over the years has been funded by, e.g., the National Science Foundation (US), American Museum of Natural History (US), Compaq (US), Portuguese Science Foundation, European Commission, European Science Foundation, DFG, European Space Agency, and NASA.

Over the years he has been involved in scientific working groups of major international projects, some related to the construction of space telescopes (e.g., WSO-UV, Athena, SIRIUS), and led/leads international consortia in, e.g., computational astrophysics, supercomputing in astrophysical fluid flow, and on HPC & HPDA (2019-2023) and HPC, HPDA & AI (2021-2027). He participated in the PRACE (Partnership for Advanced Computing in Europe; 2011-2021), EuroCC (National Competence Centres in the framework of EuroHPC; 2020-2022). Currently leads the WP6 (High Performance Computing) of the research infrastructure ENGAGE SKA, the Task 19.2 "Training and Awareness" of the NCC Portugal in EuroCC2 (EuroHPC JU) and the WP3 "Training" in the ATTRACT European Digital Innovation Hub, as well, as the ERASMUS+ Advanced Computing Consortium that involves 14 higher education institutions in Portugal. He was the european Benchmark Code Owner of the GADGET software (versions 2 through 4) under PRACE (2017-2021) and is European Training Champion for the projects EuroCC and EuroCC2.

Publishes regularly in top journals in his field and in the Nature journal.
