Explain the participation of a post-doc student  of informatics in an task with objectives, methodologies and expected results given below.

Objectives

Support the application of SASP for modeling probabilistic processes and induce SASP from Background Knowledge (BK) and evidence.

Methodologies and approaches

Implementation (i.e., writing code according to the software design specifications), testing (i.e., verification that the implemented software functions correctly and meets the requirements outlined in the design phase), profiling (i.e., analyzing the performance of the software system to identify bottlenecks, memory leaks, and other performance issues), benchmarking (i.e., compare the performance of the software system against standard benchmarks or competitors' products) and documenting (i.e., providing comprehensive information about the software system, including its purpose, features, architecture, installation instructions, and usage guidelines): 
    SASP intermediate representation and a parser.
    Integration with existing, state of the art, Answer Set Program (ASP) tools such as Potassco and cplint for the computation of the stable models.
    Instrumental functions such as: event belongs to class, class probability, event probability.
    Support for SASP combination and transformation.
    Integration with existing, state of the art, evolutionary explorations tools (e.g. genetic algorithms).
    Command-line programs to support basic usage such as: list classes, query the probability of an event or class, induce SASP.

Expected results

A basic set of tools, including a library and command-line programs, to use Stochastic Answer Set Programs (SASP) for modeling probabilistic processes and induce SASP from Background Knowledge (BK) and evidence.

STATE-OF-THE-ART


A major limitation of logical representations in real world applications is the implicit assumption that the background knowledge (BK) is perfect. This assumption is problematic when dealing with probabilistic phenomena, which is often the case. Probabilistic Logic Programming (PLP) is one ongoing effort to address this problem by extending the syntax and semantics of logic programs in order to have them represent and operate probability distributions (see [11]).

Current systems for PLP, such as ProbLog [5], P-log [3], LP^MLN [6], or cplint [7], derive a probability distribution from a program. However, for Answer Set Programs (ASP) [12] with probabilistic facts, the characterization of a probability distribution on the program's domain is not straightforward (see [1, 2, 3, 4]).

In [8] we address the problem of extending probability from the total choices of an ASP program to its stable models and, from there, to general events. Our approach is algebraic in the sense that it relies on an equivalence relation over the set of events and uncertainty is expressed with variables and polynomial expressions. In that work we show how SASP can represent arbitrary bayesian networks and therefore express any probability distribution of discrete random variables.

This representation of arbitrary bayesian networks conferes to SASP the capability to deal with a very large collection of probability problems and tasks. However, the problem of obtaining such SASP, besides hand-coded, remains open. 

In our system some unknowns are represented by numeric parameters that can be estimated later from further information, e.g., evidence. This approach, delaying the assignment of certain parameters, enables later refinement and scoring a partial program from additional evidence. 

In turn, scoring of SASP (i.e., models of a probabilistic phenomenon) is a key feature required to the application of evolutionary algorithms. From here we can explore how to induce SASP from BK and evidence.

The calculus of the score of an SASP with respect to evidence was already introduced and illustrated in [8]. It remains to investigate the application of this process to induction of SASP from BK and evidence. 

Ideas of this paper have a partial, limited, implementation, available in a public repository, that results from the work of a BII scholarship, supported by NOVALINCS "Financiamento Plurianual da unidade de I&D UIDP/04516/2020" and co-supported by Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia (FCT), Portugal.

In the general Induction of Logic Programs (ILP) setting (see [11, 13]) the goal is to algorithmically obtain a (target) logic program. For that, (1) BK (e.g., obtained from experts) is provided in the form of a logic program, describing objects and (first-order) relations of a domain and (2) observations are organized as positive evidence, that should be inferred from the target program, and negative evidence, that should not be inferred from the target program. Moreover, the target program must be (logically) consistent with the BK. ILP is a form of Machine Learning (ML) that offers significant advantages over numeric based ML. 

For one, ILP address the problem of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) because, unlike  the large-dimensional vector based models of numeric ML, logic programs are human-readable in the sense that their declarative nature describes what objects are in the domain, their structure, properties and relations.
Second, ILP describes phenomena with related instances while numeric ML is limited to a single (tabulated) relation where different instances (lines) are independent given the model. 
Third, often a target program is generated from a small set of observations, while, in general, numeric ML models require large datasets to achieve significant accuracy.
At last, expert knowledge, expressed in the BK, can be utilized to structure the target program, i.e., to model the observations. Again, this is a feature hard to achieve with numeric ML models.

Drawbacks of ILP include the computational complexity of inducing the target program and the general difficulty of logic programs to deal with data with random perturbations. While the later is being addressed by PLP in general and SASP in particular, the computational complexity of induction remains an important challenge that we propose to investigate with this project.

OBJECTIVES

In summary, with this project we aim to continue our exploration on how SASP represent probability distributions, how to use them to model probabilistic phenomena and how they can be induced from BK and evidence.

More specifically, this project's objectives are to investigate:

- The role of program structure and composition in the use of PASP to model probabilistic phenomena.
- Program transformation rules and space exploration algorithms for SASP.
- The performance of hand-coded and induced SASP models on selected theoretic and real world cases.
