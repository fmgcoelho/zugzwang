## Questões

## 2024-01-05 - Next Research Lines

> After the base-setting work of "_An Algebraic Approach to Stochastic ASP_" these are the next tasks to consider. Is summary:
> 1. **Logic Programming** - Stratified & Non-stratified programs
> 2. **Computer Science** - Inductive Logic Programming
> 3. **Software** - Integration with Potassco and other frameworks
> 4. **Applications**

#### Line 1: Logic Programming - Stratified & Non-stratified programs

##### Line 1a - Logic Programs Structure and Properties

> _Stratified_ & _non-stratified_ programs are quoted in the "CREDAL" papers as important classes of logic programs.

Minimal example of a **non-stratified program**.

The following annotated LP, with clauses $c_1, c_2, c_3$ respectively, is non-stratified (because has a cycle with negated arcs) but no head is disjunctive:
```prolog
0.3::a.                 % c1
b :- not c, not a.      % c2
c :- not b.             % c3
```

This program has three stable models:
$$
\begin{aligned}
m_1 &= \set{ a, c } \cr
m_2 &= \set{ \neg a, b } \cr
m_3 &= \set{ \neg a, c }
\end{aligned}
$$

> We should **investigate** _What are stratified programs and why are they important?_ and how does our approach deals with such programs?

##### Line 1b - Investigate the expressiveness of PASP

Consider:

- Recursion
- Variables,
- Functional symbols,

##### Line 1c - The equivalence relation

Previous work defines one specific equivalence relation in the events associated to a ASP program to score that program but other equivalence relations can provide more effective scoring algorithms. 

Consider the cases where only $s \subseteq e$ and $e \subseteq s$. Or other refinements. Also consider the inconsistent and independent events.

##### Line 1d - Stability of the error function

Consider alternative error functions. See statistics, Kullback-Leibler divergence

#### Line 2: Computer Science - Inductive Logic Programming

> Proceed from scoring programs to support genetic algorithms or other program space exploration methods.

Scoring programs, as described in our paper, is just a step into **Inductive Logic Programming**. To go further, we need to explore algorithms that:

1. Use **background knowledge**, expressed as a PLP.
2. Consult **positive examples** that should be _soft_ induced.
3. Consult **negative examples** that should be _soft_ excluded.
4. Generate **PLPs** that are scored.
5. Recombine the **best scored** into a new _population_, using recombination rules.

> In order to do that, **PLPs must be expressed as data structures** to be manipulated. Also **recombination rules** must investigated before become formally expressed and supported with adequate methods.

#### Line 3: Software - Integration with Potassco and other frameworks

> Support annotated programs with zugzwang semantics.

- Bayesian Networks (BII Alice)
  - Generate an annotated asp program from a bayesian network and run it trough `clingo`.
  - Recover the stable models from the previous ste and compute the respective probabilities.
- Program Manipulation
  - Annotated ASP program _representation_ and a _parser_.

#### Line 4: Applications

> Apply zugzwang to a few showcases, besides the theoretic corner stones (non-stratified, disjunctive, bayes networks), preferably based in real world scenarios, with complex structure and large datasets.

- (Stochastic) Plan Generation
- Yale-Shooting Problem
- (Stochastic) Situation Calculus
- Frame Problem
- Latent Facts - and core assumptions.
- Given a **Bayesian Network** (or a **Markov Networks**):
  - Represent it. (**done** for BNs; MNs?)
  - Solve the common probability tasks: join (**done**), marginals, conditionals, parameter learning, inferring unobserved variables, sample generation, _etc._
- Given a _solved_ ASP specification:
  - What is the marginal probability of the atom `a`? (**done**)
  - What other probability queries are important to consider?
- Given an _unsolved_ ASP specification:
  - What is the probability (distribution?) of the probabilistic fact `a`?
  - What other questions are relevant? _E.g._ the distribution family of a fact?
- Given a _solved_ ASP specification and a set of _samples_:
  - How do the probabilities inferred from the specification match the ones from the empiric distribution? (**done** might see alternative approaches)
- Given two _solved_ ASP specification and a set of _samples_:
  - Which specification best describes the empiric distribution? (**done**)

### Management Structure

The Administrative Services of the University of Évora are responsible for project's financial and administrative management, through its Projects Management Division (DGP). This office is organized in two areas: (i) financial contracts and administrative management and (ii) administrative support to R&D units. They are deep experienced in managing several different financial programs such as Portuguese Government Structural Funds (Portugal 2020, FCT) and Community Funds, such as Erasmus+, H2020, HORIZON EUROPE or Creative Europe.

It is DGP's main task to fulfill all the necessary operations, provide administrative support and reassure the good execution of R&D Units budgets and respective Projects.  Furthermore, it is accountable for the execution of all legal and required financial reports.

Each project is the responsibility of a project officer with expertise and experience in project management and finance. The project officer acts as a link between the Responsible Researcher and the rest of the financial team. Is also responsible to process all expenses fulfilling all the current national and European legislations.

The project officer is also in charge of the liaison with FCT (Science and Technology National Agency), European Commission and other donors by elaborating and delivering the financial reports and respective requests for payments, including reassuring all necessary procedures to the validation of expenditures.

The University of Évora owns an information system that allows the researcher to follow the project's financial implementation on a permanent basis.

PROJECT


This research aims to overcome the constraints of logical representations in real-world scenarios with probabilistic elements by expanding Probabilistic Logic Programming (PLP) with Stochastic Answer Set Programs (SASP). While current PLP systems like ProbLog provide some solutions, challenges persist in characterizing probability distributions for Answer Set Programs (ASP) with probabilistic facts. The proposed SASP approach introduces an algebraic method to represent uncertainty and integrates evolutionary algorithms for inducing SASP models. The research plan involves theoretical analysis, algorithm development, empirical evaluation, and interdisciplinary collaboration. Key objectives include investigating program structure and composition in SASP modeling, developing transformation rules and algorithms, and evaluating hand-coded and induced SASP models on theoretical and real-world cases.

State of the Art:
    PLP systems like ProbLog address limitations of logical representations with probability distributions.
    However, characterizing probability distributions for Answer Set Programs extended with probabilistic facts remains challenging.
    The proposed SASP approach extends ASP, represents uncertainty algebraically, and incorporates evolutionary algorithms for model induction.

Main Goals:
    Investigate the role of program structure in the utilization of PASP for modeling probabilistic phenomena.
    Investigate the application of evolutionary algorithms for induction of SASP models based on additional background knowledge and evidence.
    Evaluate hand-coded or induced SASP models, on theoretical and real-world cases.

Knowledge and Skills:
    The group possesses expertise in logic, logic programming, and distributed systems.
    Previous work demonstrates the feasibility and representational power of SASP.
    Collaboration with an interdisciplinary team ensures diverse perspectives.

Strategy and Methodologies:
    Theoretical analysis will explore SASP program structure effects on modeling probabilistic phenomena.
    Algorithm development will focus on transformation rules and efficient exploration of SASP space.
    Empirical evaluation will assess model performance on various cases.
    Interdisciplinary collaboration fosters innovation and ensures comprehensive research.

Novelty and Expected Results:
    The novelty lies in the probabilist semantics of SASP, the resulting score based in evidence and the utilization of that score to induce SASP from background knowledge and evidence.
    Expected results include improved understanding of SASP modeling, efficient algorithms, and validated SASP models.

Overall, the proposed research addresses critical limitations in probabilistic logic programming with ASP and aims to advance the field through innovative methodologies and interdisciplinary collaboration. The comprehensive research plan, supported by existing expertise and resources, demonstrates a strong potential for significant contributions to the field.
