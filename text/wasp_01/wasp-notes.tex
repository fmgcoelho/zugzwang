\noindent Using a \acl{LP} to model and reason over a real world scenario is often hard because of uncertainty underlying the problem being worked on.
Classic \aclp{LP} represent knowledge in precise and complete terms, which turns out to be problematic when the scenario is characterized by stochastic or observability factors. For example, medical exams illustrate both problems: a system with unreachable parts \eg\ some parts of a living organism can't be directly observed; a sensor that adds noise to real values \eg\ limits and imperfections of instrumentation.

In this work we aim to explore how \aclp{ASP} plus weight augmented facts can lead to useful characterizations for this class of problems; We assume that knowledge about a \emph{system} includes both a theoretical \emph{model}\sidenote{Use `answer set' instead of `stable model'?} and empirical \emph{data} such that:
\begin{itemize}\tight
    \item The model is an \acl{ASP} whose \aclp{SM} are the the system states.
    \item The data is a set of observations and each observation is a set of literals from the model.
    \item The weights in the augmented facts are propagated to the \aclp{SM} and, in general, to observations such as above.
\end{itemize} 

In this setting the empirical distribution from the data can be used in two different tasks:
\begin{enumerate}\tight
    \item Estimate parameteres required in the propagation process above.
    \item Evaluate the model \emph{wrt.}\ the observations.
\end{enumerate}

To frame this setting  we assume that the atoms in the model are associated to sensors of the system's states. 
More specifically, if $a$ an atom, a state can activate the sensor $a$ or $\neg a$ (strong negation) whereas no activation is represented by $\naf a$ and $\naf \neg a$ (default negation).
This redundancy is required to model hidden parts of a system as well as faulty sensors.
\sidenote{Look carefully to the relation between missing values in observations and default negation.}
For example, in
$$\left\{ a, \neg a, \naf b, \naf \neg b, \naf c, \neg c \right\}$$
both $a$ and $\neg a$ are activated (suggesting a fault in the relevant sensors), $b$ is not observed (hidden?), and $\naf c, \neg c$ reports the (consistent) activation of $\neg c$ and no activation of $c$.
If we omit the default negations and use $\co{x}$ to denote $\neg x$ this observation can be shortened to the equivalent form $a\co{a}\co{c}$. 

\begin{example}[Coins, Cards, and Dices]
    Consider a scenario where a coin is tossed and, if it lands in \emph{heads}, $a$, then a dice is thrown, $b$, or a card is drawn, $c$. If the coin lands in \emph{tails}, $\neg a$, no more action is performed. A model of this is, for example, the program  
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:derived.fruitful}
        P_{\mathrm{ccd}} = \left\lbrace\begin{aligned}
            a \vee \neg{a}  & ,          %
            \\
            b \vee c        & \clause a
        \end{aligned}
        \right.
    \end{equation}
    that has atoms $\set{a, b, c}$, literals $\set{a, \neg a, b, \neg b, c, \neg c}$ and, using the shortned form, \aclp{SM}
    \begin{equation}
        ab, ac, \co{a}.
    \end{equation}
    
    
    Possible observations include:
    \begin{itemize}\tight
        \item $ac$, short of $\{a,\naf\neg a,\naf b, \naf \neg b, c, \naf \neg c\}$: a \acl{SM}, therefore a system state, observed \emph{heads} and \emph{card}.
        \item $a$: not a \acs{SM} but contained in the two \acsp{SM} $ab$ and $ac$; observed \emph{heads} but we have no information about the \emph{cards} or the \emph{dice}.
        \item $\co{a}\co{b}$: not a \acs{SM} but contains the \acs{SM} $\co{a}$; coin observed as \emph{not heads} (\emph{tails}?); also we recorded no card drawn but have no information about the dice.
        \item $b,c$: not related with any \acs{SM}.
        \item $a\co{a}$: an inconsistent observation.
    \end{itemize}    
\end{example}

We use sets of literals, instead of atoms, to represent observations because they make possible the distintion between a \emph{explicit negative observation} $\neg\alpha$ (\eg ``I see tails.'') and \emph{not observed} $\naf \alpha$ (\eg ``The coin in hidden.''). This corresponds to assuming a ``boolean sensor'' for each $\alpha$ and $\neg \alpha$.

So, the program \ref{eq:derived.fruitful} defines the ``sensors''
\begin{equation*}
    a, \neg a, b, \neg b, c, \neg c
\end{equation*}
