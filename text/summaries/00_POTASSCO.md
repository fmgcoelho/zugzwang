## clingo

> Current answer set solvers work on variable-free programs. Hence, a grounder is needed that, given an input program with first-order variables, computes an equivalent ground (variable-free) program. gringo is such a grounder. Its output can be processed further with clasp, claspfolio, or clingcon.
>
> [clingo](https://potassco.org/clingo/) combines both gringo and clasp into a monolithic system. This way it offers more control over the grounding and solving process than gringo and clasp can offer individually - e.g., incremental grounding and solving.
